# Imperative vs Declarative programming

Imperative is when you tell hardware or api's how to achieve a task. For e.g., picture.show(); to display a picture vs frameData.changePixels(pixelsArray, pixelsArrayData);

We build tools using imperative programming to enable declarative programming, since declarative programming is more human oriented.
